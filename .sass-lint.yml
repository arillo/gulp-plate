  # Allow file extensions when importing files.
  # Reason: when using the `includePaths` option
  # for Sass and retrieving files from a dir that contains
  # both .scss & .css files with the same name, the Sass
  # compiler does not know what file to use (even though he
  # can't process .css files) and needs the extension to
  # know what file to use.
